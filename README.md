High Quality JavaScript Code
============================

Code example to go with Den Odell's presentation on High Quality JavaScript Code: https://www.slideshare.net/denodell/highquality-javascript-code

Files
-----
* `dates.js` - Simple script showing module pattern, dependencies, ECMAScript 5 strict mode, and documentation in YUIDoc format
* `dates-spec.js` - Simple Jasmine unit tests for testing the methods exposed from `dates.js`
* `GruntFile.js` and `package.json` - Configure Grunt task runner with JSHint, Jasmine, and Istanbul

Running
-------
* Install Node.js
* Install Grunt-CLI
* Open command prompt/terminal and `cd` to this project folder
* Execute `npm install` on the command line to download all the dependencies and plugins for Grunt (first time only)
* Execute `grunt` on the command line - this will run JSHint, Jasmine, Istanbul, complexityReport.js and YUIDoc, feeding back results to the command prompt window
* Check the generated `reports` folder for the code coverage report generated by Istanbul after running the Jasmine unit tests, and details of any issues running the cyclomatic complexity report
* Check the YUIDoc generated HTML documentation extracted from your code by looking in the `docs` folder
* If you want to have Grunt running all the time, listening for file changes and auto-running, then execute `grunt watch` at the command line
